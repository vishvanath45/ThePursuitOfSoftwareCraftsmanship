>`Honing one's craft is boring`

Hi, This blog is collection of my learning along the way while chasing the art of software development, I feel that software development is art, like a painting, and software devs are painter. 

No one is perfect and trying to become better day by day. I plan to publish my learning, the intended audience are software devs who just started and have some prerequisite knowledge on linux system.

I welcome any critism positive or negative on contents of blog.

Feel free to reach out to me at visitdutt[a@t]gmail[d0t]com
