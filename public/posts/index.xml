      <description>Honing one&#39;s craft is boring
 Hi, This blog is collection of my learning along the way while chasing the art of software development, I feel that software development is art, like a painting, and software devs are painter.
No one is perfect and trying to become better day by day. I plan to publish my learning, the intended audience are software devs who just started and have some prerequisite knowledge on linux system.</description>
